3. Summary 

While I’m starting my journey in tech, my enthusiasm and drive to grow are what set me apart. I see every project as an opportunity to learn something new, and I’m eager to contribute to the success of any team I join.
In addition to my work in development, I have a strong personal interest in car tuning, I do it on the side but I haven't focused on it fully. By continuously learning and applying new technologies, I aim to bridge the gap between coding and car tuning,
 building tools that enhance how people interact with their vehicles. My enthusiasm, adaptability, and passion for both fields will make me a valuable asset to any team,
especially those working at the intersection of technology and automotive industries.

No places that I've worked too, only uni projects and car tuning.
